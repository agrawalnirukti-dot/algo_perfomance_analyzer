Algorithm Visualizer & Performance Analyzer

Repository Name: algo_performance_analyzer

Description: A terminal-based visualization tool designed to demonstrate the execution flow and performance metrics of various sorting algorithms. The project serves as a bridge between theoretical Time Complexity and practical implementation.


Key Features:

Real-time Visualization: Uses terminal graphics to show array manipulations, helping to visualize O(n 
2
 ) vs. O(nlogn) behaviors.

OOP Architecture: Built using Object-Oriented Programming principles to ensure the codebase is modular and easily extensible for new algorithms.

Performance Benchmarking: Includes a measurement module to evaluate execution time and memory overhead during sorting tasks.

Technical Skills Demonstrated:

Object-Oriented Design (Classes, Modularity) 

Performance Profiling & Analysis 

System-level Programming in C++
